ENGI1006 Final

Hi!  For this project, I closely followed the guidelines (including the options provided for the two pages).  In my app.py file, I defined routes for each page (home, classes, assignments, 1006).  (I included a 1006 page as part of the optional exercise so I could test the Flask set-up.)  I also chose to use bullet points for my class, assignments, and site pages lists.  I also included a link at the bottom of each page to route back to the homepage.  In my process, I also experimented with web scraping (this was mostly just for me) because I wanted to practice with other python libraries.  I wrote a function in web_scrape.py to take the urls of an input webpage, and called this function in app.py.  I didn’t really know what to do with the information I scraped (all of the urls embedded in a movie webpage), so I just printed them all onto a page called “links” (routed in app.py).  But, since href takes a string, I didn’t know how to return a string that includes a string (i.e. two sets of quotes), so I couldn’t return this urls as links and I couldn’t embed the “return to home” button at the bottom of this page. I also have a folder called pycache and something called DS_Store (not really sure what either of these are doing) so I added this to my gitrepo just in case.

Thanks for all your help this semester!  Hope you stay well and have a decently relaxing summer.

Best,
Zoë
