    <p>Here are the classes I am taking this semester:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Quantum Mechanics II</li>
    <li>Electromagnetic Waves and Optics</li>
    <li>Intro to Computing</li>
    <li>Intermediate Italian II</li>
    <li>Physics and Philosophy</li>
    <li>Design Futures</li>
    </ul>
    <p>My favorite class this semester was Waves and Optics.  
    While I don't <b>love</b> electromagnetism itself, this made a lot of connections 
    to other fields in physics that I do find interesting (like QFT).  There was a 
    decent amount of overlap between this course and my quantum mechanics course. But 
    mostly I adored my professor, who is one of the kindest and zaniest people 
    I've ever met.</p>
